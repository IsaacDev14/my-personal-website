        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>I’m Isaac Mwiti, a curious soul diving into the world of web development. I love turning ideas into code—whether it’s tinkering with HTML, tweaking CSS, or dreaming up JavaScript magic. Outside of screens, I’m hooked on music and I’m here to share my journey, one pixel at a time.</p>

      <section id="Portfolio">
        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio—where my ideas come to life! This is my space to show off what I’ve been building, from data science, music, wesite to interactive tools. Highlights include personal blog I coded from scratch. Each piece is a step in my journey to master, and I’m excited to keep adding more. Take a peek and let me know what you think!</p>
